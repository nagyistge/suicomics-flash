AS3 Client for SuiComics
========================

### Introduction

This project includes several Flash/AS3 applications for the SuiComics web service project. See http://github.com/tedwen/suicomics for more.

### Applications

#### SuiReader

It is a plain ActionScript program to read comic pages on the web server.  Virtual goods embedded inside the comic pages can be bought without leaving the interface.

#### SuiQuest

Creators can build quests to make their books more interesting. This program is the game engine for such a quest.

#### SuiGallery

Readers who enjoy collecting virtual goods can build their own virtual space using this program. It works like a treasure collection game on Facebook.
